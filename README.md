# Book-Review-API
Build a RESTful API using Node.js (with Express) for a basic Book Review system.

---

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB + Mongoose
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Tools**: Postman (Testing), dotenv

## üì¶ Project Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

- git clone https://github.com/AarDG10/Book-Review-API.git

### 2. Install Dependencies

- npm install -y

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following:

PORT=3000 <br>
MONGO_URI=yourmongourisetup<br>
JWT_SECRET=yourSuperSecretKey 


> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure MongoDB is running locally or use a cloud instance like MongoDB Atlas (Have Used Atlas for this task, setup using aws free tier).

### 4. Run the Server

- npm run dev

It is to be noted that the main server file is server.js that conducts the server start and linking with mongodb etc..
After The Server is Up and Running , Further Testing can be done via Postman or Curl Req. (Have Used Postman for this task)

## üì¨ API Endpoints & Sample Requests (Testing of Endpoints done via Postman)

#### `PUT /reviews/:id` ‚Äì Update Review

- Endpoint: http://localhost:3000/reviews/REVIEW_ID

### üîç Search

#### `GET /search?query=Atomic` ‚Äì Search by title/author (any keyword)

## üß† Design Decisions & Assumptions

- A user can review a book **only once**, can be altered but locked in for control check cases of spam review.
- Pagination is applied to both books and reviews using `page` and `limit`.
- Search is **case-insensitive** and supports partial matches.
- JWT is used for secure, stateless authentication.
- MongoDB is chosen for flexible schema and fast and ease of development.
- Assuming 'genre' attribute that is part of the book schema is not really required since some books may not have genres

## üß© Database Schema (MongoDB with Mongoose)

### User

```js
{
  username: String,
  password: String, // hashed
}
```

### Book

```js
{
  title: String,
  author: String,
  genre: String,
  reviews: [ObjectId], // references Review
}
```

### Review

```js
{
  user: ObjectId,   // references User
  book: ObjectId,   // references Book
  rating: Number,   // 1 to 5
  comment: String,
  createdAt: Date
}
```
